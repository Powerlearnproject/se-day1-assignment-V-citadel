Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering reffers to the process of desinging ,developing, testing and maintaining software applications using established engeneering principles.
software engineering has the following importance in the technology industry firstly it improves efficency, innnovation and problem solving in tech. Secondly it helps bring new products to market while also improving on the existing ones.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960's(Birth of software engineering) During this era the concept of structured programming emerged which improved code clratity and efficiency. 
1970's(rise of object oriented programming) this milestone saw  making code more modular and resuable.
2000's(agile manifesto) this milestone sought fro an iterative and collaborative approach.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement analysis- team gathering and take note of the needs of the stakeholders/ customer 
design- where the overall structure of the software is planned 
implementation- developers writing the actual code.
testing -stage where the software is checked for bugs and errors.
deployment - releasing the software for use.
maintenanace - where the software is  updated and improved based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is linear and sequential in nature and rigid while Agile methodologies is more iterative and flexible depending on customer feedback an example of when waterfall is used when creating banking systems or hospital systems and for agile is used in app development , ecommerce websites and MVP.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - responsible for writing the code, maintaing code and fixes bug.
quality assuarance engineer - tests software for defects, ensures quality and standards are met.
project manager-oversees the project , coordinates between teams, managaes timeleins and resources.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs streamline coding with tools in one place, improving productivity examples are Visual Studio code
vcs track code changes and enhance collaboration and rollback when required example include  GIT and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some of the challenges include debugging complex code, security vulnerabilities,project delays, addressing this challlenges include the following ways:use automated testing to check bugs early , apply secure coding standards, use project management tools.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - checks for individiual components,Focuses on small code units like methods, functions, or classes.
intergration - assesses combined units this helps verify dataflow between modules and detects interface issues
system - validates the entire application, the importance is so as to ensure that the sysytem behaves as it is supposed to. 
acceptance - ensures software meets required and ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promt engineering refers to the process of crafting effctive prompts to guide generative AI  models to produce accurate and relevant outputs. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague promt("write a story") engineered promt("write a story that advocates for environment sustainability in Kenya") the improved promt clearly indicates the specifications that i require hence the response will be tailored to my ask.
